Leavings is a poem written by Robin Robertson who is still alive by the way, the poems scene is based upon the wintertime and the snow. The photo uploaded by Tolu Olarewaju on the other hand is just a photo with footprints in the snow, I called them footsteps on the page due to the fact that it gives it a little flair.
